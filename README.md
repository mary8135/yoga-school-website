# Yoga School Website

A playground website. I'm working on it as I learn.

### Skills used so far:

- Photoshop
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Git


### Progress log:

- Used Photoshop for image editing, and Figma to design the website;
- Started translating it into HTML and CSS using Bootstrap;
- Changes tracked with Git on Terminal;
- As I progressed, I started getting a few Bootstrap conflicts, namely on item placement and margins which I fixed using custom CSS;
- Bootstrap wasn't allowing me to design the UI exactly as I wanted, and more and more conflicts were appearing as I added new sections. So I decided to remove Bootstrap completely from some of the sections and designing them from scratch with plain CSS and flexbox;
- Landing page is now looking good, and as complete as it can be with what I know so far;
- The Navbar toggler isn't working. I created it using Bootstrap but can't find out what's happening. I may just replace it with a custom one once I learn JavaScript.
